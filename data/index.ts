      `In 2019, I came to Dhaka to pursue my graduation and got admitted to Primeasia University for a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).
      It was during my time at the university that I developed a passion for programming. I learned all the basic concepts and technologies, which laid the foundation for my journey into the world of software development.`,
      `My web development journey began when I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course at Programming Hero. The course provided a deep dive into MERN stack technologies, which include MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. From there, I started exploring and building projects using these technologies, gaining hands-on experience in creating dynamic and responsive web applications. This journey has been instrumental in shaping my skills as a full-stack developer, with a particular focus on the MERN stack. As I continued to hone my skills, I became more passionate about web development, constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to stay updated with the latest industry trends.`,
